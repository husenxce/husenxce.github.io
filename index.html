                  After completing Stanford University's online machine learning course I wanted to implement a neural network package. Since there weren't many neural network packages for JavaScript I implemented a single layer neural network with one output. Users can use this neural network to implement stock market prediction or any other predictive operation based on labeled data. [Individual Project]

                      Multicast is a form of communication that delivers information from a source to a set of destinations simultaneously in an efficient manner; the messages are delivered over each link of the network only once and only duplicated at branch points, where the links to the destinations split. Important applications of multicast include distribution of financial data, billing records, software, newspapers, pay-per-view movies; audio/video conference; distance learning; and distributed online games. In order to ensure that only authorized users can access the multicast data, the data are encrypted using a cryptographic key known as the group key. The group key is known only to authenticated and authorized members of a multicast group. Every time a membership change occurs, the group key must be changed to ensure backward and forward secrecy. Group key management refers to the actions taken to update and distribute the group key upon members joining and leaving a multicast group.  [Group Project]

                      The project consisted of many classes to maintain modularity and the user interface was build using the commandline option of the NetBeans IDE. In addtion the software architecture was represented using UML diagrams. To ensure that specs of the application were met there were many unit tests written using JUnit. [Group Project]

                      This project explores the implementation of seat assigning program in different languages. More
                      specifically this project explores the strengths and pitfalls of implementing the program in Java,
                      JavaScript and C languages. Various aspects such as compactness, object oriented features and ease of
                      use factors were used to asses the strengths of different languages. More over languages like
                      JavaScript were found to have inconsistencies with string and number comparison. On the other hand
                      Java had strengths in object oriented design and C had low memory usage. Use case, sequence, state
                      and class UML diagrams were used to further study Java implementation of the program. [Individual Project]

                      Synchronization of page usage for different processes was implemented in the
                      get_process_mem(prc_id) function, this was the most challenging aspect of this project. Threads are
                      created for each process passed in the watch command. The synchronization of each thread is
                      maintained by global variables which keep track of each thread's status and clock_gettime() function
                      keeps track of the time. Three different time operations are running at any given time for the watch
                      command. These include the sleep() function, the clock_gettime() funciton and a time dependent
                      integer variable. Therefore the server.c file is compiled with -lpthread library aswell as -lrt library to
                      support clock_gettime() function. Once the log has finished recording all the page usage data and it
                      sends it to the client then writes “*End of Watch *” to the socket. This is read by the client and it
                      allows the client to exit the read() loop. [Individual Project]

                    was implementend from the  features  described  in  the CPU specification document. Consulted the specification document while proceeding to test the CPU.

                    The goal of this project was to implement a state machine diagram to enable robot's autonomous navigation. Sensor information was used from the front and back bumpers of the robot so when it hit a wall it rotated 180 degrees. The motors were also enabled and programmed to implement the state machine. The state machine was expressed as sub-routines where each state was implemented using a specific sub-routine. The project was written in HCS12 Assembly language and the robot was programmed using the Code Warrior IDE. [Individual Project]

                    The objective of this project was to find the DH Convention paramenters for the robot. And then use those paramenters to find the homogeneous transformation matrix for use in forward kinematics. Also the equations for inverse kinematics were also solved. Then the robot was simulated in matlab using Robot Toolbox. [Individual Project]

                    The objective of this project was to design a PID control system by studying the characteristics of an industrial servo module. Each of the P, I and D controllers were carefully designed considering the behaviour of the servo. Mehtods such as ultimate gain was used to calculate crucial constants. [Group Project]

                    The objective of this experiment was to use a combination of non-linear circuits to design and simulate a voltage controlled waveform generator on MultiSim and             then further implement the design on a bread board. The non-linear circuits were an integrator, inverting bi-stable, voltage converter, digital switch, and                   amplitude control and amplitude correction circuit. [Group Project]
