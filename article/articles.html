                In contrast to native app development the cross platform framework Ionic provides developers an opportunity to build for multiple platforms from a single code base. But this comes with its own cons that have to be carefully considered to decide if developing using Ionic is an economic choice given the budget limit for a specific project. As it is evident in the figure Ionic requires a total of 8 stages until the app is deployed on the app store. This figure accounts only for the front-end developer's work load. Since Ionic is built on top of Angular JS there are extra development stages which pertain to the browser(Chrome/Firefox). Because of this workflow the development timeline is much more longer than native apps.</p>
                  <p> The stages A to C are the least tricky to implement and should mostly be used to decide last minute functional or design changes that would not be possible later on in the development process. The development process starts to get heavy from stage D. This is where most of the bugs for the browser are visible as bulk of the logic and styling would already have been implemented. After finishing up fixing bugs for stage D developer will want to move to stage E which is the device testing stage. But this is where the app starts to show more signs of underlying bugs which are much more harder to debug. Every effort should be made by the developer to reach stage E as soon as possible. This will not only prevent any delays to the schedule but it will also allow ample time to start fixing bugs on the device. From stage E to G is the longest part of the development process. This is also where the most number of bugs arise as shown in the graph. So fixing device specific bugs will guarantee smooth and functional apps. The final stage H is the finish line for the development process where most of the bugs on the device have been fixed. If the developer reaches the last stage within a specific deadline for the project then it shows that time was managed well for each stage. But if there was unexpected delay then time was not managed appropriately for each stage.
